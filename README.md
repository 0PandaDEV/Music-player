Vleer is a lightweight and fast privacy first music app replacing your traditional Spotify or Apple Music. It serves the purpose for people that don't have enough money or don't want to pay monthly subscriptions, this is why Vleer is completely free and will stay that way.

üöß Despite undergoing a major rewrite since January 2024, Vleer is already showing great promises in terms of functionality. We are actively seeking contributors to help us continue improving the project. If you are interested in contributing, we welcome your participation.

## ü§ù Contributing

To get Vleer set up on your machine, you'll need to have Rust and pnpm installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/vleerapp/Vleer.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd Vleer`
3. Install dependencies: `pnpm i`
4. Run the development server: `pnpm dev`

## üõ†Ô∏è Building for Production

```zsh
pnpm build
```

Don't worry, it will fail at the end because it can not detect a Private key, but the installer files will be generated regardless of that.

You can find them in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle`.
